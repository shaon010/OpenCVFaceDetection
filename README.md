OpenCVFaceDetection
===================

Starting of my journey with OpenCV


This is a sample source for openCV java example with face detection.

Please follow some rules to run this code:
1. Do not give any space in project folder name when you create new project in eclipes (this will show no error, but your code 
will never work!! My 6 hours has been wasted for this bug of windows! )
2. Put the casacde file and input file in bin folder.
3. I've added .substring(1) after evry path. Without this, your code will output an empty file. This is also a bug of windows.
 (Search google for details)
